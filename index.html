		<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
		<p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>
		I am interested in programming and information security, i became obsessed during my late teenage years when i scraped up all money I had for a desktop computer.
		I could not get a job for a many years in any form of IT role due to what I suspected a lack of experience until 2004 where to my surprise I got a network engineer role.
		Since then, i worked in few similar roles, System administration, programming and eventually landed in information security analyst role.
		In IT specifically, I am most interested in PowerShell, python, c, malware analysis.
		</p>
		<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
		I need tertiary education to emigrate eventually to US or Canada.
		<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
		Hopefully some things other than what I already know learnt in years of experience.

		<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
		<p>My ideal job is Cyber Security Analyst.<br>
		Example listing: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/68028017?type=standout#sol=266b54748f4d3d11e35678cee4fde483010a60dd">https://www.seek.com.au/job/68028017?type=standout#sol=266b54748f4d3d11e35678cee4fde483010a60dd</a><br>
		<br>Snapshot of this job saved to <a href="CyberSecurityAnalystJobinMelbourneVIC-SEEK.pdf">CyberSecurityAnalystJobinMelbourneVIC-SEEK.pdf</a><br>
		This particular role involves the essential tasks of a security analyst (monitoring and responding to threats) and it appeals to me because as well as adding new capabilities and procedures, this role will allow me to play a critical role in the team and contribute fresh ideas and propositions to yet maturing informaiton security setup.
		Some of the functions of this role are:
		<ul>
			<li>Developing and revising of business operational processes, making recommendations for enhancing business processes </li>
			<li>Establishing and documenting processes to ensure effective cyber security outcome</li>
			<li>Enhancing detection and response capabilities</li>			
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		To apply for this role, at a minimum I would need understanding of how operating systems work, networking and cybersecurity and privacy principles. I would also need extensive knowledge and experience in IDS(intreusion detection systems), EDR(Extended Detection & Response) products like CrowdStrike, Sentinelone, Defender and experience in investigating threat events, for instance, a suspicious destination ip detection or anomalous process activity.
		<br>Also, recruiters are asking for 3 to 5 years' experience in the IT security industry.
		</p>
		<p>My current skills and experience are:
		<ul>
			<li>Monitoring and detecting threats on various operating systems and networks using IDS and EDR</li>
			<li>Developing threat detection use cases, playbooks and runbooks</li>
			<li>Threat hunts and simulations</li>
			<li>Splunk SIEM</li>
			<li>Network routing and switch security, 802.1x, ipsec</li>
			<li>Intermediate level coding in python, C#, PowerShell, C, C++</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>A plan describing how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position,
		<p>Having just several years experience of detecting and responding to threats with IDS and EDR, I would likely need to obtain several Industry certifications such as FOR508: Advanced Incident Response and Threat Hunting, familiarize myself with Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework.
